                                                Not all items are pretty enough to be stored in clear view. To maintain a cleaner look, utilize hidden storage ideas for small spaces that keep things out of sight but still accessible. Furniture tricks, like this flip-top upholstered storage bench, can stylishly disguise items you'd rather not display. </p>

Enjoyed all aspects of it. This was my second time to the Storehouse, but this was so much fun with friends. We were able to do the Stoutie and Academy tickets. Thus was so fun.

                                                Many homes lack sufficient closet space, which can make entryway storage, in particular, quite a challenge. To make up for the scarcity of storage ideas for small spaces around your front door, add a variety of hooks and open shelves to create a customized dropzone that works for your family. Use bins or baskets on the shelves to sort belongings by family member or type of item. </p>
